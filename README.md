# Sentiment-Analysis-for-Product-Reviews

This project performs **Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Built during my internship at **Mentoga** via **Skilled Score**, it classifies customer feedback as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** — helping businesses gain insights from reviews at scale.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a machine learning pipeline that can:

- Clean and preprocess textual data
- Analyze the sentiment of product reviews
- Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

## 🧠 Key Features

- Cleans and tokenizes raw review text
- Converts text into numerical features (TF-IDF / CountVectorizer)
- Trains models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM
- Evaluates performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score
- Supports visualization of word clouds and sentiment distributions

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- NLTK / spaCy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / WordCloud
- VS Code

## 📦 Dataset

- Includes thousands of real-world product reviews  
- Columns: Review Text, Sentiment Label  
> *(Used for learning and experimentation only)*

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-product-reviews.git
cd sentiment-product-reviews
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script or Jupyter notebook:

bash
Copy
Edit
python sentiment_analysis.py
📈 Model Performance
Accuracy: 88-92% (depending on model used)

F1-Score: Balanced for both positive and negative classes

Confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report included

📌 Future Enhancements
Add deep learning models (LSTM, BERT)

Create a web dashboard using Streamlit

Include multilingual sentiment detection
